## projects
__Optical Character Recognition for Handwritten Syriac Text:__ 
> This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model so as to recognize handwritten text of the Syriac language and output them in a digitized format using fine-tuning of the Tesseract-OCR engineâ€™s LSTM pre-trained model on handwritten data. And it also seeks to bring forth a dataset that consists of handwritten Syriac sentences, of which were collected from volunteers that are capable of reading and writing in the language.
