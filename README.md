## Projects
__Optical Character Recognition for Handwritten Syriac Text:__ 
> This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model so as to recognize handwritten text of the Syriac language and output them in a digitized format using fine-tuning of the Tesseract-OCR engine’s LSTM pre-trained model on handwritten data. And it also seeks to bring forth a dataset that consists of handwritten Syriac sentences, of which were collected from volunteers that are capable of reading and writing in the language.

## What I Believe
> I believe in the synergy of two things: egalitarianism and libertarianism. I can not imagine a world where my freedom is substituted for something material, nor is it fathomable to my conscience that someone, somewhere on this planet is deprived of the very things I take for granted, be it food, shelter, clothing, etc.. Call it what you want: anarchist, libertatian socialist, leftist, or whichever term you prefer. All that I know is that the pursuit of a well-deserved life for all of humanity is a meaningful pursuit to me, and I despise all those who deprive humans of their natural rights. Everyone deserves the produce of mother nature, and mother nature requires us to care for it and not result in its annihilation.
